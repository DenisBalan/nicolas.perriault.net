![me](/static/img/me.png){:class="cover"}

My name is **Nicolas Perriault**, I live in southern France near Montpellier and
am pretty much **enjoying my life**.

I'm a freelance [Web developer](/code/), self-employed by my own tiny company,
**Akei**. I'm specialized in [Python](/tags/#python), [Django](/tags/#django),
[JavaScript](/tags/#javascript), [Elm](/tags/#elm) and am well-versed into
[Open Source Software](https://github.com/n1k0). **I work remotely exclusively.**

Previously, I worked for cool companies like [Clever-Age](https://www.clever-age.com/),
[Sensiolabs](https://sensiolabs.com/fr/), [Allo-Media](https://www.allo-media.net/),
[Scopyleft](http://scopyleft.fr/) and [Mozilla](https://mozilla.com/).

I [speak](/talks/) at conferences, <del>sometimes</del> rarely now.

I also practice [photography](https://500px.com/n1k0), [music](https://soundcloud.com/n1k0),
and [rant (in French)](/carnet/) <del>a bit too much</del> rarely (nowadays
I occasionally use [Twitter](https://twitter.com/n1k0) for that purpose).

The source code of this blog and most of its contents are
[open sourced on Github](https://github.com/n1k0/nicolas.perriault.net).
